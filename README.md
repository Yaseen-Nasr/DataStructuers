# DataStructuers (Working on)
This repository contains a collection of commonly used data structures ,
that I have implemented to better understand how they work under the hood.
To keep the code organized, I've created a separate class library project to hold all the data structures.

To make it easier for users to interact with the data structures, 
I've also created a layer of abstraction by providing methods that encapsulate the underlying implementation. 
This allows users to focus on using the data structures without needing to worry about the details of how they are implemented.

Here are some of the data structures that are included in this repository:

Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Tree, Hash Table,
 I have provided detailed documentation and code examples for each data structure to make it easy for users to understand how to use them . I hope this repository will be useful for anyone looking to learn more about data structures and their implementation.
